## Best Practices

### Scene Organization
1. Keep scenes modular and reusable
2. Use scene inheritance for similar objects
3. Group related nodes logically
4. Use descriptive node names

### Scripting Guidelines
1. Use type hints for better AI assistance:
```gdscript
extends Node2D

var health: float = 100.0
var player_name: String = "Player1"
var inventory: Array[Item] = []
```

2. Document functions with comments:
```gdscript
## Handles player movement based on input
## @param delta: Time since last frame
func handle_movement(delta: float) -> void:
    pass
```

3. Use signals for loose coupling:
```gdscript
signal health_changed(new_health: float)
signal player_died
```

### Performance Tips
1. Use object pooling for frequently spawned objects
2. Implement proper scene loading/unloading
3. Cache node references in _ready()
4. Use yield() sparingly

### Web Export Considerations
1. Keep asset sizes small
2. Use compressed textures
3. Implement proper loading screens
4. Test frequently in browser

## Common Pitfalls
1. Not using type hints (makes AI assistance harder)
2. Over-complicating scene hierarchies
3. Not implementing proper scene cleanup
4. Ignoring web performance considerations

## AI-Assisted Development Tips
1. Keep scripts focused and single-purpose
2. Use clear naming conventions
3. Document complex logic
4. Break down tasks into small, manageable chunks
