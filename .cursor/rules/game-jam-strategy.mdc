# Game Jam Development Strategy

## Time Management (10-hour constraint)

### Planning Phase (1 hour)
1. Define core gameplay loop
2. List essential features
3. Create minimal viable product (MVP) scope
4. Set up project structure

### Development Phases
1. Core Mechanics (3 hours)
   - Basic player movement
   - Essential game mechanics
   - Simple UI

2. Content Creation (3 hours)
   - Level design
   - Basic assets
   - Sound effects

3. Polish & Bug Fixing (2 hours)
   - UI improvements
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes

4. Testing & Export (1 hour)
   - Browser testing
   - Export configuration
   - Final adjustments

## Development Priorities

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Core gameplay loop
2. Basic controls
3. Simple win/lose conditions
4. Minimal UI

### Nice to Have
1. Sound effects
2. Visual polish
3. Additional levels
4. Particle effects

### Skip If Time Runs Out
1. Complex animations
2. Multiple levels
3. Advanced features
4. Extra game modes

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

### Effective Prompts
1. Be specific about requirements
2. Include context about current implementation
3. Ask for incremental improvements
4. Request explanations for complex logic

### Code Review Process
1. Review AI suggestions before implementing
2. Test changes immediately
3. Keep track of implemented features
4. Document any workarounds

## Web Export Checklist

### Pre-Export
1. Test in Godot's web preview
2. Verify asset loading
3. Check performance
4. Validate controls

### Post-Export
1. Test in Safari
2. Verify loading times
3. Check mobile compatibility
4. Validate touch controls

## Common Time-Saving Tips
1. Use placeholder assets initially
2. Implement features incrementally
3. Don't spend too much time on perfect future-proof project setup
4. Focus on gameplay over graphics
5. Reuse code and assets when possible
6. Keep scope manageable
